        Pontianak is the capital of the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan, <br>
        founded by Syarif Abdurrahman Alkadrie as a capital of Sultanate of </br>
        Kadriyah on 23 October 1771 / 14 Rajab 1185 AH. Syarif Abdurrahman Alkadrie <br>
        developed Pontianak as a trading port on the island of Borneo, occupying an area </br>
        of 107.82 km² in the delta of the Kapuas River. It is located on the equator, hence it is widely known as Kota Khatulistiwa (Equatorial City). 
        The city center is less than 3 kilometres (2 mi) south of the equator.<br> 
        Pontianak is the 26th largest city in Indonesia in terms of population, <br>
        as well as the fourth largest city on the island of Borneo (Kalimantan) <br> 
        in terms of population after Samarinda, Banjarmasin, and Balikpapan. 
        The city was founded as a small Malay fishing village at the bank of <br>
        the Kapuas River. It then became the seat of the Pontianak Sultanate for several centuries. Pontianak was then incorporated into the Dutch East Indies after an agreement between the Pontianak Sultanate and the Dutch Government. During the colonial era, Pontianak was the seat of the Residentie Westerafdeeling van Borneo, one of the residencies of the Dutch East Indies. When the Japanese occupied the Dutch East Indies, Pontianak became the site of the Pontianak massacre, in which many Malay aristocrats and sultans as well as people from other ethnic groups were massacred by the Imperial Japanese Navy, especially in the Massacre of Mandor (Holocaust of Mandor).
        After the Japanese surrendered, Pontianak became part of the Republic <br>
        of Indonesia and was designated as the capital city of the province <br>
        of West Kalimantan.
        Pontianak is a multicultural city, as different ethnic groups such <br>
        as the Dayak, Malay, Bugis people, and Chinese live in the city, <br>
        with some transmigrant such as Javanese, Madura people, Bataks, Ambon <br>
        people, Papuan transmigrants, Manado people, etc. This has created a unique culture that can not be found in other parts of Indonesia. Different languages are spoken in Pontianak, such as Pontianak Malay, Dayak language and different dialects of Chinese and some varieties of Malays, Dayaks, Javanese, Bataks, Bugis, etc.
        Pontianak is connected by air to other cities of Indonesia as well <br>
        as some cities in Malaysia such as Kuala Lumpur and Kuching. Well paved <br>
         roads connect Pontianak to other towns such as Ketapang and Singkawang as well as other provinces. As Pontianak lies on the Trans Kalimantan Highway, it is possible to travel to East Malaysia and Brunei by land using the Trans Kalimantan Highway. Several bus routes operate from Pontianak to Kuching in Malaysia and Bandar Seri Begawan in Brunei.
