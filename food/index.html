               Chai means vegetable. From here, you might have guessed that this cake uses the main ingredient, 
               namely vegetables. The shape of Chai Kue does look similar to pastels, but can be served steamed 
               or fried. The skin of this Chai Kue is made from a mixture of rice flour and tapioca flour. 
               For the filling itself, you can use vegetables such as soybeans, bamboo shoots, chives, taro,
